## Project Description and Goals

...Site was build as a platform to publish my personal web-development projects..
..., enable people easily refer to me on the internet and collaborate.
...One of the main principal laying on the ground of this project is simplicity and..
...unusual design solitions.
...The navigation counts only four parts. \About and \Works are intuitively predictable.. 
...relative to their content. The initial idea about \Read is to keep posted interesting..
...topics from web. But in the future I would like to transform this part of the site..
...into a list of my own publications.
...Site serves both an idea to introduce an author's professional profile.., 
...and also to reviel his personality.
